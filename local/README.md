# Local Docker 
Running Docker locally offers significant benefits for developers, including consistent environments, streamlined dependency management, and faster development workflows, ultimately leading to more reliable and efficient software delivery. We will be using Docker Desktop which is a one-click-install application for your Mac, Linux, or Windows environment that lets you build, share, and run containerized applications and microservices. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
